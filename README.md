# 🍽️ Dishes Model

This repository demonstrates how to perform image classification using Python, Keras, and Jupyter Notebook.  
We use a dataset of dish images from around the world, categorized into six cuisine classes:

- American  
- Chinese  
- European  
- Indian  
- Japanese  
- Korean

The notebook `dishes_model.ipynb` serves as an educational guide, showcasing how to build and train a neural network using transfer learning.  
**Note**: The resulting model is not intended for production use but is a solid foundation for learning, experimentation, and future extensions.
